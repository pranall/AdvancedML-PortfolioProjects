# AdvancedML-PortfolioProjects
Hi, these are all the projects I did in Advanced Machine Learning.

**Facial Recognition System with Siamese Networks:** The project aimed to develop a Siamese Network to determine whether an image contained a celebrity face. The network was trained and evaluated on separate datasets to achieve robust performance, generalize to unseen images, and handle variations in pose, lighting, and background. The final model classified images as containing a celebrity face with high confidence.

**YOLO Object Detection:** The project involved developing an object detection system for self-driving applications using YOLOv5 to identify vehicles such as ambulances, buses, cars, motorcycles, and trucks with the Roboflow OpenImages dataset. The dataset contained 627 images and 1194 annotations, organized into train, validation, and test folders, along with a YAML file defining class names and path configurations. The objective was to train three YOLOv5 variants—YOLOv5s, YOLOv5n, and YOLOv5m—to achieve high-accuracy vehicle detection in real-world conditions.
