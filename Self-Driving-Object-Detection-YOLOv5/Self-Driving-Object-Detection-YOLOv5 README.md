YOLO is an object detection framework that performs detection and classification in a single pass using one CNN. It operates in real time, divides the image into a grid, assigns objects to cells, and outputs bounding boxes with class probabilities. It detects multiple objects per image and has evolved through versions such as YOLOv2–YOLOv4 with improvements in speed and accuracy.

YOLOv5 introduced a more efficient architecture, higher accuracy, faster inference, and stronger data augmentation and training procedures. It delivered state-of-the-art performance with sub-50 ms inference on GPUs, making it a more capable and flexible detector than earlier YOLO versions.

YOLOv5 is available in 5 different version such as:
